# Min-max Scaling on Numeric Values to a New Range and Compute Summary Statistics

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of minmaxsummarize is to provide a function `shrink_and_summarize` that can scale a numeric vector to fit within a range using min-max scaling and compute summary (mean, median and std). 

## Installation

You can install the development version of minmaxsummarize like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("stat545ubc-2024/minmaxsummarize")
```

## Example

This is a basic example:

```{r example}
library(minmaxsummarize)
x <- c(1, 2, 5, 50, 100, NA)
shrink_and_summarize(x, 0, 10)
```
